        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          We present the AgriCruiser, an open-source over-the-row agricultural robot developed for low-cost deployment 
          and rapid adaptation across diverse crops and row layouts. The chassis provides an adjustable track width of 
          1.42 m to 1.57 m, along with a ground clearance of 0.94 m. The AgriCruiser achieves compact pivot turns with 
          radii of 0.71 m to 0.79 m, enabling efficient headland maneuvers. The platform is designed for the integration 
          of the other subsystems, and in this study, a precision spraying system was implemented to assess its effectiveness 
          in weed management. In twelve flax plots, a single robotic spray pass reduced total weed populations (pigweed and Venice mallow) 
          by 24- to 42-fold compared to manual weeding in four flax plots, while also causing less crop damage. 
          Mobility experiments conducted on concrete, asphalt, gravel, grass, and both wet and dry soil confirmed 
          reliable traversal consistent with torque sizing. The complete chassis can be constructed from commodity 
          T-slot extrusion with minimal machining, resulting in a bill of materials costing approximately $5,000-$6,000, 
          which enables replication and customization. The mentioned results demonstrate that low-cost, reconfigurable 
          over-the-row robots can achieve effective weed management with reduced crop damage and labor requirements, 
          while providing a versatile foundation for phenotyping, sensing, and other agriculture applications. Design 
          files and implementation details are released to accelerate research and adoption of modular agricultural robotics.
